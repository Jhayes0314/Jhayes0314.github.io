# About Me
## My Interest are reading and history which happily coincide together by reading old documents an interesting fact is that I got to read a copy of Thomas Jefferson's dairy at my girlfriend's college and it was the most interesting thing to read and see how he felt about certain events in our country's founding and subsequent important events after.
## Websites I recommend
[Radio Garden](https://radio.garden)- This is used to discover what radio stations are playing around the world!
[National Archives](https://www.archives.gov)- Used to look up historical documents along with service members records which I will be using for my family tree.
